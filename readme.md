## TF - Simple Shop (in Laravel)

# Goal
Extend the existing Laravel application so that it can calculate the total for a sample shopping basket, and save the basket contents and total to the database.

# Guide
The existing Laravel application has the following things already set up:
- A Dockerised basic installation of Laravel (setup instructions below)
- A small product catalogue which can be accessed here: http://localhost:8080/api/products

You will need to use the Products API to generate a sample JSON shopping basket, e.g.
```json
{
    "basket" : [{
            "product" : "Apple",
            "qty" : 2
        },
        {
            "product" : "Banana",
            "qty" : 1
        }
    ]
}
```

Create a API endpoint to which you can POST your sample basket JSON

This endpoint will then need to do two things:

- Calculate the total of the basket (using the existing Product model) and return it as JSON
- Save the contents of the basket to the database (you will need to make the appropriate table structure)

If you have a GitHub/Bitbucket account please put the code in a public repository and send me a link.
